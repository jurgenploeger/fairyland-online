"""Splits each race's walk sheets into paper-doll layers, like Fairyland Online dressed its heroes:

    art/sprites/body_<race>.png          the body, bald (the hair taken off, the scalp drawn in)
    art/sprites/locks_<race>.png         a beard, which stays whatever the style (copied, so the
                                         body stays whole; empty for the clean-shaven)
    art/sprites/hair_<style>_<race>.png  every hairstyle, fitted to every race's head
    art/sprites/hood_<race>.png          a hood and a helmet sized to the bare head; the game
    art/sprites/helmet_<race>.png        colours them like the armour (see MARKERS below)

A gender with its own walk sheet (classes.json `sheets`) gets the same set with a _<gender> suffix
(body_elf_male.png, ...), and its own hair (side locks, braids, a ponytail and all) is one more
style for that sheet alone: appearance.json `styles` with a `sheet`.

The game stacks body + locks + hair (or body + locks + hood/helmet: no hair pokes through). The
body is recoloured like the whole sheet used to be (skin, hair, outfit); the locks and hair layers
hold nothing but hair, so the hair colour reaches every shade of them (appearance.json
`hairLayer`). A style moved onto another head is lined up with its skull and brow, kept off its
face, opened where an elf's ears poke through, and painted in that sheet's own hair colours, so
one head has one hair colour before any dye. Rerun after changing a walk sheet:
